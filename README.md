# My personal Nvim configuration

## Setup

Clone this repo into `~/.config/nvim/` or copy-paste just the parts you like.

This configuration can make use of a "Nerd Font" for icons and symbols. Download one here: https://www.nerdfonts.com/ and set it as your terminal font.

### Linux installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramongss/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
